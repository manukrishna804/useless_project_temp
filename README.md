### Project Description
This project is a hilarious twist on authentication ‚Äî you can only log in if you smile üòÅ. Once inside, you‚Äôll find equally ‚Äúuseless‚Äù OpenCV-powered features like a video that only plays when your eyes are closed and a draggable watch that shows the time in the silliest way possible. Built with Flask, OpenCV, and zero seriousness.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt that normal logins with usernames and passwords were just too practical? Or that videos playing while your eyes are open were just too mainstream? We‚Äôre here to solve these completely non-problems with cutting-edge, absolutely unnecessary technology.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We replaced boring passwords with smile-powered facial recognition, because why type when you can grin? Then we took videos and made them only watchable when you can‚Äôt see them (eyes closed). And for the grand finale, we gave you a draggable watch that tells time in the most ridiculous way possible. All thanks to Flask, OpenCV, and questionable life choices.
